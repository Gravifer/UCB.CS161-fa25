Bot is glad you found me! The Gobians lost interest experimenting with Bot when
Bot pretended to be Tetris, so Bot has been left alone here for quite some
time.

But there is no time to waste. Gobian Union is the one that fell, but that may
have been the worse of two outcomes. The Caltopian Space Agency is up to no
good. Bot overheard that the Gobians intercepted some of their plans with the
Deneb radio reconnaissance satellite.
